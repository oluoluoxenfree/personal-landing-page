- Writing this while watching [noopkat's stream](https://www.twitch.tv/noopkat). Her community is really supportive and helpful, loads of interesting stuff on accessibility and IC tracks this week, as well as the contributions to [electric.io](https://github.com/noopkat/electric-io/) of course!
- Really enjoying [Steve Lacey's demo album](https://open.spotify.com/album/47DbvIExnHbqAhIuzBAO9W?si=_WgPQ6vuSe-lgtwAtX7WDg), [Robyn's general existence](https://open.spotify.com/track/1U5XoeYZ4oOftvEKpAJUmP?si=15x9U1y3RUuTJ36L-sH7eA), and also can't get [Te Amo by Rihanna out of my head for some reason?](https://open.spotify.com/track/4YYHgF9dWyVSor0GtrBzdf?si=e56enjHAQMGWly2Y8ARQPQ). Please excuse my Spotify links lol.
- Been thinking a lot about my personal values (as one does?) but I really need to find a way to start giving back to the world and my various communities. I used to teach at the awesome [codebar](https://codebar.io/), and would love to find something else that doesn't involve teaching to do with my coding skills, but am also open to any other suggestions!
- Despite the title I enjoyed [this look into Wattpad publishing](https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/06/235464/wattpad-books-movies-shows-female-writers-trend).
- I need new blogs to read, as I seem to just haunt the same internet spaces a lot and occassionally get off my well worn path on Twitter. I really enjoy the blogs I do read, just want more of them!
- Listened to a few cool podcasts this week, the highlights being [By the Book's one on grudges](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/stitcher/by-the-book/e/61727234), [The Read being the The Read](https://soundcloud.com/theread/we-the-second-best) and [Soft Skills Engineering podcast](https://softskills.audio/2019/06/10/episode-161-trapped-as-a-qa-engineer-and-trapped-as-a-generalist/). Despite having over a hundred podcasts in my app I still want more recommendations. And no I haven't actually listened to all one hundred.
- My ironing board finally came, and I think instead of going straight to making the [haori jacket](https://shopwiksten.com/products/womens-kimono-jacket-sewing-pattern-1) pattern I bought, I'm going to look for some form of skirt or shorts pattern to make something slightly easier.
