- Finished two great books: [Speak No Evil by Uzodinma Iweala](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B074Z9W8W6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and [Audre Lorde's The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master's House](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Masters-Tools-Dismantle-Penguin-Modern/dp/0241339723/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2DPNYNRQM1U8K&keywords=the+masters+tools+will+never+dismantle+the+masters+house&qid=1561288440&s=books&sprefix=the+masters+tools%2Cdigital-text%2C150&sr=1-1). The latter I struggled with the terminology at first - and I still did prefer the more literal essays - but chatting through what she meant by the poetic for example helped a lot. The former, most of the reasons I struggled with it are spoilers unfortunately, but it is beautifully written.
- Started trying to sew, but discovered the elastic I have is too wide for [the shorts](https://www.moodfabrics.com/blog/the-piper-shorts-free-sewing-pattern/) I wanted to make, and too narrow for [the skirt](https://www.seamwork.com/catalog/jenna), so I'll have to wait until even more deliveries here to start, sigh. This'll be my first sewing project in a very long time so keep me in your thoughts in this trying time.
- It's pride month and [this essay](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/shannonkeating/lesbian-cruise) is topical and brilliant.
- Tried to do [#1000WordsOfSummer](https://tinyletter.com/1000wordsofsummer/archive) and failed after the second day to write a single word, typical. I'm enjoying the emails though and might start a less ambitious challenge once it's over.
- [This week's not-a-meme is wholesome](https://twitter.com/TwoPaddocks/status/1142281862145925123?s=20)! And has [a follow up](https://twitter.com/TwoPaddocks/status/1142569217847250944?s=20).
- I have a confession; I really enjoy watching people with money make questionable life choices. This is currently expressed by watching videos about tiny homes - humans in hutches, all through their own choice! - but [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2AMqinJZ3E) ruined my fun as they seem to be a startup. There's no kitchen! It's in a bloody concrete pipe, I don't think I could stand up in there. Whose idea was this was? I just want to talk.
