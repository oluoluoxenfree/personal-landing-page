- started some meetups, isn't it?
- [codebop](https://www.meetup.com/Codebop-London/) is a music-making, listening, hanging out and performing meetup which also has [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codebop)
- [subversion](https://www.meetup.com/subversion/) is about how to be the best developer you can be for all life on the planet; just, intersectionally feminist and aware of all the issues currently plaguing our industry. [Its Twitter is here](https://twitter.com/subversionconf)
- [wildcard](https://www.meetup.com/wildcard/) is literally for hanging out and meeting other developers, eating food and having a beverage. [Its Twitter is here](https://www.twitter.com/wildcard/)
- yes, this is a lot of meetups. no, I can't choose one. please help in any way you see fit, haha.
- I had a lot of fun designing my plans for this year, and subversion was originally on the list I swear, just as a conference, but I got good advice it's probably best to scope out how much people want it first with a meetup.
- went to [new adventures](https://newadventuresconf.com/2020/) conference, which was fantastic.
- went to [you got this](https://2020.yougotthis.io/), also fantastic.
- discovered I love sphinx cats, who knew?
- started exercising which was fun but really hard, who knew
- all in all, I think I've done pretty well?! Especially considering it's only the beginning of the year
