Sorry for the delay folks! It's only been _checks watch_ a few months, gulp, forgive me.

I've been really enjoying all my year end/decade beginning planning. So far I am using:

- [The Life Map](https://muchelleb.com.au/products/the-life-map)
- [Design Your 2020](https://shop.getbullish.com/collections/design-your-2020)
- [Goal Crafting Intensive](https://complice.co/event/plan2020?r=de622vfncp)

And I'll eventually add this year's [Susannah Conway's](https://www.susannahconway.com/) Unravel Your Year and a new [Happiness Planner](https://thehappinessplanner.com/) to the list when they drop. Yes that's a lot of stuff, no I don't find it too much, yes I am very intentional and scared of failure, thank you for noticing.

The quick (and only the main ones of course) list of my goals is here:

- Reading [Francesca Ramsey's](https://twitter.com/chescaleigh) [Well, That Escalated Quickly](http://www.wteqbook.com/). I started reading it in anticipation of a fledging Youtube channel, which you may notice isn't on the list above. Maybe next year, maybe if the podcast turns out to be easier than I'm anticipating, but not a top priority.
- Need to buy a desk and I dunno if I want a standing one, a standard but wide IKEA one, or something else entirely. Furniture is so goddamn expensive.
- My reading retreat is coming up, which is an annual tradition of a friend where we secrete ourselves and some other friends into a small place in the woods somewhere in the UK and catch up on all our reading we should have been doing all year. It's always fabulous and I am greatly looking forward to it.
- I really want a tricycle, ideally to commute/travel to places on but also maybe just to amuse myself locally? It's very extravagant.
- I've recently started working with a PT who is absolutely amazing, and I'm really excited to see how much regular movement improves my life.
